# Advanced Rendering: Line renderer

With the power of VBOs and shaders we now have a wide range of possibilities to control how we render our particle system.

In this project we'll see how to render our particles as lines with a new renderer: ```RenderLines```

We'll also show how to use an ``ofFbo`` to create a trail effect.


### What has changed from the previous project:
- Added new shaders ``bin/data/shaders``
